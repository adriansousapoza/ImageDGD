# ConvDecoder Hyperparameter Analysis & Recommendations

## üéØ Hyperparameter Importance Ranking (Most to Least Critical)

### **Tier 1: Critical Architecture Parameters**
1. **`latent_dim`** - Fundamental dimensionality, affects model capacity
2. **`hidden_dims`** - Controls progressive feature expansion, directly impacts quality
3. **`output_size`** - Target image dimensions, must match dataset
4. **`output_channels`** - Number of output channels (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB)

### **Tier 2: High Impact Training Parameters** 
5. **`activation`** - Choice of activation function significantly affects training dynamics
6. **`final_activation`** - Critical for output range (sigmoid for [0,1], tanh for [-1,1])
7. **`use_batch_norm`** - Major impact on training stability and convergence speed
8. **`init_size`** - Starting spatial dimensions, affects upsampling strategy

### **Tier 3: Regularization & Stability**
9. **`dropout_rate`** - Important for preventing overfitting in complex models
10. **`kernel_size`** (currently fixed at 3) - Should be configurable for different receptive fields
11. **`stride`** (currently fixed at 2) - Should be configurable for different upsampling rates

### **Tier 4: Fine-tuning Parameters**
12. **`padding`** (currently fixed at 1) - Affects spatial dimensions preservation
13. **`bias`** (not currently configurable) - Can affect convergence
14. **Normalization alternatives** (GroupNorm, LayerNorm, InstanceNorm)

## üö´ **Missing Important Settings**

### **Critical Missing Hyperparameters:**
1. **Kernel Size Control** - Currently fixed at 3
2. **Stride Control** - Currently fixed at 2  
3. **Padding Control** - Currently fixed at 1
4. **Bias Toggle** - Should be configurable
5. **Normalization Type** - Only BatchNorm available
6. **Upsampling Method** - Only transpose convolution available
7. **Skip Connections** - For better gradient flow
8. **Spectral Normalization** - For training stability
9. **Progressive Growing** - For high-resolution generation

### **Advanced Architecture Options:**
10. **Attention Mechanisms** - Self-attention for long-range dependencies
11. **Residual Connections** - For deeper networks
12. **Dense Connections** - For feature reuse
13. **Separable Convolutions** - For efficiency
14. **Dilated Convolutions** - For larger receptive fields

## üèóÔ∏è **Good Decoder Structure for Image Data**

### **Proven Architectures:**
1. **Progressive Upsampling** ‚úÖ (You have this)
   - Start small, gradually increase spatial dimensions
   - Your current approach is good

2. **Feature Map Progression** ‚úÖ (You have this)
